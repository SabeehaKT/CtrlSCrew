    "story_text": "Maya was a talented software engineer working on a critical product launch. For three weeks straight, she stayed late at the office, skipped lunch breaks, and checked emails before bed. Her team celebrated when the product went live, but Maya felt exhausted rather than excited. The next morning, she struggled to focus on her new tasks and found herself staring blankly at her screen. Her manager noticed and suggested she take the rest of the day off, but Maya worried about falling behind."
